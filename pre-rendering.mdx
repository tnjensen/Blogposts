Next.js has two froms of pre-rendering: **Static Generation** and
**Server-side Rendering**. The difference is in **when** it generates
the HTMl for a page.

**Static Generation** is the pre-rendering method that generates the
HTML at **build-time**. The pre-rendered HTML is then _reused_ on each request.

**Server-side Rendering** is the pre-rendering method that generates the HTML on **each request**.

Importantly, Next.js lets you **choose** which pre-rendering form to use for each page. You can create a "hybrid" Next.js app by using Static Generation for most pages and using Server-side Rendering for others.
